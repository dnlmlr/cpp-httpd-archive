# cpp-httpd
A simple http-webserver framework written in C++ with the goal of high performance and versatility. The API is roughly inspired by express.js and drogon. This is purely an educational project and not suitable for any kind of production use. Many parts of the HTTP spec are not implemented (or at least not correctly)
